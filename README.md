I am a MD/PhD student studying Neuroscience at UC San Diego. I graduated _magna cum laude_ from Harvard University, where my honors thesis investigated the relationship between minority stress and self-injury in sexual and gender minority adolescents. After completing my bachelorâ€™s degree, I worked at Massachusetts General Hospital with the Cardiac Psychiatry Research Program, where I launched a clinical trial of a collaborative care intervention for patients with comorbid cardiovascular and psychiatric conditions. 

I am currently working with Terry Jernigan and Anders Dale, using a combination of genetics, neuroimaging, and behavioral data. I received a 2022-2023 [Kavli Institute for Brain & Mind Innovative Research Grant](https://kibm.ucsd.edu/research/innovative-research-grants) for my project applying genetic information to improve prediction of adolescent brain development trajectories.
